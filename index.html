        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a dedicated smart contract developer at Lazarus, a company renowned for its expertise in security, NFTs, and
        digital products. With a wealth of experience and a dynamic team of 11 professionals, I've consistently showcased my
        prowess in smart contract development, testing, and implementation.
        
        My journey in the blockchain space began in 2020 when I ventured into cryptocurrency trading and investments. This
        initial foray ignited my curiosity about decentralized systems and peer-to-peer networks, propelling me into the
        exciting world of blockchain technology.
        
        As a versatile developer, I've actively contributed to three pivotal projects spanning user security, NFTs, digital
        products, and identity solutions. My adaptability shines through as I navigate diverse domains with ease.
        
        My skill set encompasses a wide range of programming languages, including Solidity (advanced), C, Python, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Golang, SQL, and MongoDB. I'm well-versed in popular ERC standards and have successfully deployed various
        smart contracts, including DeFi and GameFi applications. Additionally, I've contributed to UI/UX development to support
        my team's success.
        
        Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm deeply passionate about blockchain education and mentorship. During my college
        years, I had the privilege of mentoring students, imparting knowledge about cryptocurrencies, web3, Bitcoin, and the
        future of blockchain technology. I also organized engaging gatherings where students, seniors, and instructors came
        together to explore the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
        
        In October 2023, I proudly earned my degree, a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and growth. My
        unwavering dedication to staying updated with the latest blockchain trends ensures I remain at the forefront of this
        rapidly evolving industry.
        
        My vision for the future is to contribute to decentralized systems that empower regular internet users with greater
        financial rewards, data privacy, and improved ecosystems compared to centralized alternatives. As such, my favorite
        Dapps are DeFi, blockchain-based esports, and digital identity solutions.
        
        My journey in blockchain has been a transformative experience, and I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of
        what's possible in this ever-evolving space.

            <h3>Deal Station: The Ultimate NFT Swapping Platform</h3>
            <p>Our web app provides a unique solution for NFT holders who want to swap multiple NFTs for a single NFT. With our
            easy-to-use platform, users can initiate deals, lock their NFTs in escrow, and complete transactions seamlessly. This
            feature is especially important for collectors who want to consolidate their holdings or trade up for a more valuable
            NFT. But the benefits don't stop there. Our web app will also offer a secure and transparent way to exchange NFTs in
            cross-chain. This means lower fees and faster transactions for our users. In order to improve usability and create "The
            App" for on-chain barter, we'll also implement ERC4337 and Users will also be able to add their ERC20 tokens to
            synthetic assets to create wrapped NFTs that can be exchanged for a service or another NFT.
